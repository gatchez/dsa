# Array Data Structure

## Overview

The Array is a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

## Features

- Fixed size allocation
- Random access (O(1))
- Cache-friendly memory layout

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|-----------|
| Access    | O(1)      |
| Insert    | O(n)      |
| Delete    | O(n)      |
| Search    | O(n)      |
